			<h1>FAQ</h1>
			<h3>What is Firetable?</h3>
			<p>
				A way to listen to music with friends.
			</p>
			<h3>Who is Jarvis?</h3>
			<p>
				Jarvis is a bot. He keeps the order.
			</p>
			<h3>How do I join the waitlist?</h3>
			<p>
				!addme
			</p>
			<h3>Is there a limit to how many songs I can play?</h3>
			<p>
				Yes and no. When you are on the table and there are other people waiting to DJ, you get 2 songs before Jarvis will remove you and re-add you to the queue.

				The chat and your queue will keep working, but songs will stop progressing until the bot returns.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I change my name?</h3>

			</p>
			<h3>Can I change my robot avatar?</h3>
			<p>
				Robot avatars are generated based on a combination of your username and userid. So if change your username, you'll also be changing your robot.
			</p>
			<h3>I typed !addme but I am not on the table how do i get on the table now that I have typed !addme i think there must be a mistake because i did type it but i do not see myself there in the thing?!?!?!?!?</h3>
			<p>
				The DJ table is probably full and you've been added to the waitlist. As the DJs all play 2 songs each, spots will open up and those spots will be filled from the waitlist.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I run my own instance of Firetable?</h3>
			<p>
				Yeah.<br/>
